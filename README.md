# Business-English-Site
I'm someone who is quite passionate about language learning and I really loved teaching English
while I was living in Japan, however a lot of positions online to teach English pay abysmally low
,because of this I'm thinking of setting myself up as a business English teacher with a target 
audience of Japanese adults who are looking to learn/improve their Japanese for work purposes, though
this is mostly aimed at people working in tech. and who have some existing ability with the language.
